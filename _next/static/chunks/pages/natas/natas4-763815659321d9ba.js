However, as noted in the documentations, there are actually some security concerns with it, mainly that if a page contain things such as social media widgets or images from a third party, since they are requested from an external site, they would be able to access what page those requests are coming from. The main concern MDN highlighted was if such widgets and images are located on a sensitive page, such as a reset password page.

This might be an alternative solution, I felt a little cheap not manipulating the header directly. Say that I fully do not have access to the website, could I simply change my header?

So, using POSTMAN, a popular REST client, I set the request to GET, put the right link, then I typed in Referer as one of the key in the header, and the natas5 website link as the value. Note however that, to access the site, we had to insert a password. This is why I didn't try this method earlier.
