      I noticed a picture of a single pixel, first I thought,
      perhaps it is hidden in this dubious one pixel picture.
      I tried inspecting its contents using vim and xxd without
      much luck. Perhaps the hint that there&apos;s nothing in this
      page is a little more accurate. So I noticed that the pixel
      was located in the files folder, so I added that to the 
      website link and amazingly, a text file was there.
