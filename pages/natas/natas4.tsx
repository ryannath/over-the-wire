      After reading several stackoverflow answers on the questin of faking
      the referer in the header, I got a little frustrated, it seem like
      I had to use an extension. But I have previously opened a natas
      page previously and cancel the prompt asking for credentials and I
      noticed that you are still located at the right address. So,
      I went to natas5 page, cancel the credential prompt, and edited
      the html document. I inserted an anchor tag with a link to
      the natas4 page. I clicked the link I made in natas5, and I was
      given access to natas4.
    </div>

export default natas4
